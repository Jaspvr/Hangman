# Hangman
This program works with user input, arrays, strings, functions outside of main(), nested loops, if statements, and functions from the string.h, stdlib.h, and time.h libraries.
There are likely simpler ways to implement a hangman game, but I wanted to demonstrate and practice my understanding of multiple topics in C!

Compile command: gcc -Wall -std=c18 -o gcc -Wall -std=c18 -o github github.c
Run command: ./github
