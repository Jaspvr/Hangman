# Hangman
This program displays working with user input, arrays, strings, functions outside of main(), nested loops, if statements, and functions from different libraries.
There are likely simpler ways to implement a hangman game, but I wanted to demonstrate and practice my understanding of multiple topics in C!

Compile command: gcc -Wall -std=c18 -o gcc -Wall -std=c18 -o github github.c
Run command: ./github
